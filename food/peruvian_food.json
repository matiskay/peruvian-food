{"directions": "The original recipe is done with Peruvian white corn, it has the biggest grain in the world and it can be cut off the cob and peeled to prepare for the recipe, but I substituted it for just the frozen bags that we can find in any grocery store. Preferably, grind the corn using a grinding machine , not blender (as last resource you can blend the corn in a good blender using very little liquid). Set aside. Blend the salt, pepper, cumin, vinegar and red dried chile (previously roasted and deveined). Cut the meat into medium sized pieces and marinade for about an hour in the previous mix. Brown the meat in a teaspoon of lard, add the left over marinade and the two cups of water, and bring it to a boil, simmer to cook for two hours. Remove the pieces of meat and set aside. Add the broth to the corn, the rest of the lard, peanuts, sesame seeds, 6 yolks and the glass of Pisco ( if you can't find Peruvian Pisco leave it like that, don't substitute). Work the dough until it makes \"eyes\", or air bubbles. Set aside. To prepare the banana leaves you must pass them quickly over open fire (gas burner) or grill, exposure to high heat will bring out the flavors they release and turn them flexible enough to be used as wrapping. Make sure to take off the thick nerve like center of the leave. To put the tamales together:. take about three spoonfuls of dough and place them on the center of a piece of banana leaf. dig a hole in the middle and place a piece of meat, a piece of egg, an olive, one peanut, and a wedge of the fresh aji Mirasol, this may be substituted by any fresh chile, although the aji Mirasol or aji amarillo (yellow chile) has a very distinctive flavor and is just mildly spicy. Close the hole on the dough by adding a little bit more dough or folding and tapping it closed,pushing some of the surrounding dough on it. Wrap well with the banana leaf, closing tightly all four sides on top of the dough. Use another piece of banana leaf to wrap the tamal again starting on the opposite direction and tie tightly using a string cut out of some more banana leaf or a common piece of string. Set aside. Place the corn cobs at the bottom of a deep pot (rather big or medium size)and some of the banana leaves on top of the corn cobs. Add just enough water to cover the leaves. Place the tamales vertically and side by side so the steam travels freely through them and cover them with the rest of the banana leaves. Cook for about 4 hours. Serve with a type of onion salad called salsa criolla. Salsa Criolla:. Chop a whole onion julienne style, rinse once with water and salt, and pat dry. Cut one or two small tomatoes in thin wedges. Add two tablespoons of mint leaves, two tablespoons of cilantro leaves, and one fresh aji amarillo (yellow chile) deveined and sliced. Toss everything together and add the juice of half a lime, freshly squeezed. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Vegetarian fillings include sliced avocados, sliced or grated cheese, sliced or chopped tomatoes, corn kernels, thinly sliced red onions. \u2022Garnishes: Hard-boiled eggs and pitted black olives are the classic Peruvian garnish. You can also use shredded or whole lettuce leaves or any of the filling ingredients to garnish. \u2022Sauces: Sauces are often drizzled over a finished causa.

Peruvian roasted chicken is popular for a reason - the unique combination of spices gives the meat exceptional flavor. The dish has an interesting history: it was made famous by a couple of Swiss expats in the 1950's at their restaurant La Granja Azul (which is still a popular Lima restaurant). They designed and patented the mechanical spit that roasts multiple chickens simultaneously (el rotombo). Peruvian roasted chicken always comes with delicious hot pepper sauces. The red sauce typically has quite a kick, but the green sauce and the creamy yellow aji sauce tend to be milder and sweet. The green sauce is typically prepared with queso fresco or mayonnaise and the Andean herb called huacatay, or Peruvian black mint. The creamy yellow sauce is made with aji amarillo chile peppers. Pollo a la brasa always comes with sides - usually thick cut french fries, fried yuca, corn on the cob, and onion salad/relish. Some places offer tortillas and beans and rice, a more Central American touch. For the complete Peruvian experience, wash everything down with an Inca Cola. If your takeout place has desserts, be sure to try them too!

Jim\u2019s Additional Step: Once removed from the oven, sprinkle top with additional shredded cheese. Lay a piece of aluminum foil over the top and set on stove top for a few additional minutes. The goal is to allow the additional cheese to melt as a second layer of melted cheese on the top of the hot casserole. Don\u2019t worry, the casserole will retain all the heat required to melt the addition cheese \u2013 don\u2019t go wild here \u2013 just a nice additional thin melted topping.

{"directions": "Grease a 12-inch rectangular bread mold and cover with 2 large pieces of plastic wrap making sure they overlap so all the bottom and sides of the mold are covered and there is enough wrap on the sides of the mold so as to fold it once the causa has been assembled and you can tightly cover it. PREPARE THE RELISH:. To start the relish, finely mince the red onion, place it in a bowl and cover it with the vinegar; allow to rest for about 45 minutes. POTATO PASTE:. Place potatoes in a large pot with enough cold water to cover them by over 2 inches of water, add 2 tablespoons of salt and bring to a boil. Cook for about 25 minutes, until potatoes are tender when pierced with a knife. Drain and let them cool until you can handle them safely. Meanwhile, place the jalapeno pepper slices along with their juice in a blender and blend until smooth. Strain the mixture, separating the juice from pulp and keeping both. When the potatoes are cooled, peel them. Once they are peeled, press the potatoes through a potato ricer or the fine side of a cheese grater, making sure no lumps remain. Place potato paste in a large bowl and add the lime juice, canola or corn oil and 4 tablespoons of the jalape\u00f1o juice. Mix with a potato masher, adding salt and pepper to taste. Place in the refrigerator until cooled. TO COMPLETE THE RELISH:. Strain the onion, discarding the vinegar; mix with the cilantro, a little bit of salt and pepper, 1/2 cup of the minced yellow peppers, the lime juice and 1 tablespoon of the jalapeno pulp (not the juice). Taste and check seasoning adding more salt, pepper, juice or paste if desired, according to preference. MAKE THE CAUSA:. Mix the crabmeat with the mayonnaise and the lime juice; season with salt and pepper to taste. Place in refrigerator. Cut the avocado in half lengthwise, removing the pit. Cut each half in half again, making a total of four wedges. Using a large spoon, scoop each full avocado wedge out of the skin. Cut 1/4-inch thick slices across each avocado wedge (not lengthwise). Season with a little bit of salt, pepper and sprinkle some lime juice over all the slices. PREPARE THE TERRINE OR BREAD MOLD:. Once the potato paste is cooled, use a large spoon to spread 1/3 of the paste into a layer at the bottom of the bread mold. Use the backside of the spoon to evenly coat all of the bottom. Place 1/2 of the avocado slices in the mold for the next layer \u2014 making sure all corners and sides of the mold are covered with avocado. Set aside six dollops of crabmeat mixture for the serving. Now place 1/2 of the remaining crabmeat mixture into the mold for the next layer. Press down firmly with the back of a spoon. Repeat with one layer each of potato paste, avocado and crab, and then finish with a layer of potato paste on top. Fold the plastic wrap over the top of the mold (use more plastic wrap if needed to seal the top well). Press slightly and put in the refrigerator to chill well, at least one hour. (Place the extra crabmeat mix into the refrigerator as well.). To serve, carefully uncover the plastic wrap from the top of the mold. Unmold the crab causa over a serving platter. Spread some of the relish over the top of the causa. Place chopped lettuce leaves on six serving plates.

If you want you can keep some of the seeds to make it spicier. In Peru we use aji panca, but this works well too. Blend the vinegar, garlic, aji panca (or dried chile), and all other ingredients with 1/2 cup of the oil until you have a soft paste. Pour it on the pieces of heart and distribute evenly so all pieces are well covered and can absorb the marinade. Cover and let sit in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Do not let them marinade for too long or they will dry out because of the vinegar. In the meantime, place thick bamboo skewers to soak in water so they don't burn when they go on the grill. Use a charcoal grill and make sure the coals are very hot before you start. Stick three or four pieces of heart in each skewer, so that the meat lays flat. Save the rest of the marinade in a cup or small bowl and add the rest of the oil to it, mixing well. This will be used for basting the anticuchos on the grill. Tie some pieces of fresh corn husk with a string made out of some more husk and shred them half the way to make a kind of brush and use it for basting. (You can use dry husk too but you need to soak it for a while in warm water to make it flexible and then pat it dry before you use it). When the coals are ready and the grill is hot place the anticuchos flat on the grill and baste them generously with the leftover marinade and oil mix. This will drip and cause the coals to flame, make sure it flames over because this is what gives the anticuchos their distinctive flavor. Let anticuchos cook for about 1 minute and a half on each side. DO NOT OVERCOOK! They will dry out and become tough. Medium or medium well is fine. Turn them over continuously and keep basting and flaming until they are done. Hold two or three at a time to turn them over quickly. At the same time, place the pieces of corn and potatoes on a corner of the grill, baste them with the same marinade and allow them to be flamed too. Serve three skewers in each plate, accompanied by one piece of corn and one potato. You can also cut the potatoes in half (across not length wise) and stick a piece at the end of each skewer. Serve hot, right out of the grill, don't let it get cold! ENJOY! :P. What takes the longest time is to slice and cut the heart in squares and stick the pieces on the skewers; as you get practice doing this it will be faster, allow yourself some more time of preparation the first couple of times. You can also use regular beef, chicken, fish, prawns, or lamb to make anticuchos, but the original and traditional recipe calls for cow heart. Hope you like it! :).

When traveling around the world, dining on local cuisine is an important part of exploring different cultures and regions.

Waldo and I had become friends when I was employed by St. Luke\u2019s/Texas Children\u2019s Hospital in Houston. As our friendship progressed, he had invited me to Peru, which I accepted My visit coincided with the convening of the Peruvian Congress of Cardiology at which I was invited to make a presentation. At the banquet that terminated the convention, I was introduced to the Peruvian National Drink \u2013 the \u201cPisco Sour.\u201d This drink was so delicious, I had to have the recipe and was given the original recipe by Waldo who had obtained it from the vineyard at Tabernero. I will publish this shortly. The next day, I was invited to visit the military hospital there in Lima by Dr. Jaime Contrerous, the Director of all the military hospitals in Peru. Dr. Contrerous invited me back into the patient exam area where he introduced me to a quite large gentleman on a treadmill. It turned out that this gentleman was the then \u201cPresident for Life\u201d or dictator. He was the last dictator of Peru before he stepped down and allowed free elections. \u201cEl Presidente\u201d invited me to lunch at his personal golf course the next day. He sent his personal car to pick me up and deliver me to the golf course. When I arrived, I found a marvelous wonderland of flowers that I had never seen before. Birds of Paradise were everywhere. I was startled to see peons everywhere watering each flower by hand with huge water buckets. Other peons were cutting the grass on the course by hand using giant scissors! El Presidente had his staff set up tables on the 18th green and we were served lunch there. The first course turned out to be ceviche made with the local langostinos.
